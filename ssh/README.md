# Server Basics and SSH

## General

This document provides a brief overview of servers, SSH, and how to use SSH RSA key pairs for secure remote access.

## What is a server?

A server is a computer or a system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

## Where servers usually live

Servers can be physically located in data centers, server rooms, or they can be virtualized and hosted in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

## What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked computers.

## How to create an SSH RSA key pair

To create an SSH RSA key pair:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Use the following command:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your email address.
3. Follow the prompts to specify the file location and passphrase (optional).

## How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair

To connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair:

1. Ensure your public key (`id_rsa.pub` by default) is in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote host.
2. Use the following command to connect:
   ```
   ssh username@remote_host
   ```
   Replace `username` with your username on the remote host and `remote_host` with the host's IP address or domain name.

## The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash

Using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` at the beginning of a script instead of `#!/bin/bash` allows the script to find the Bash interpreter regardless of its location in the filesystem. This is particularly useful when the script needs to run on different systems where Bash might be installed in different directories.
